# `new` : file templating system

`new` is a file templating system for the command line.

_It uses a template directory/file structure,_
```
❱ treecat ~/.local/share/new/templates/webapp
webapp/
  new.template
  │ §dir§:Dir
  │ §project§:Name
  │ §version§:Version
  ╰─────────────────────────────
  §dir§/
    manifest.webapp
    │ {
    │ 	"name": "§name§",
    │ 	"version": "§version§"
    │ }
    ╰────────────────────────
```

_asks user for values,_
```
❱ new webapp
Dir     : myapp
Name    : My App
Version : 0.0.1
```

_and replaces those in directory names, file names and content._
```
❱ treecat myapp
myapp/
  manifest.webapp
  │ {
  │ 	"name": "My App",
  │ 	"version": "0.0.1"
  │ }
  ╰────────────────────
```
